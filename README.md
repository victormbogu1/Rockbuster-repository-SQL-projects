# Rockbuster-repository-SQL-project
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

Objectives:

Rockbuster Stealth LLC - Expectation of data-driven answers that they can use to improve their company strategy.

Task:

My task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have. I also compile the results of my analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.

Data Set:
Data was provided by the Rockbuster company and during this analysis I used a data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things.

Tools:

PostgreSQL - using a management tool called Pgadmin4 to connect to data.

DbVisualizer - to extract an entity relationship diagram and create a first draft of a data dictionary.
